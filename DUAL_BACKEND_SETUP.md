# EduGen AI - Dual Backend Setup Complete ✅

## Current Status

Your dual-backend architecture is now ready for deployment!

### ✅ What's Been Completed

#### Node.js Backend (Study Mode) - DEPLOYED ✅

- **URL**: https://edugen-backend-zbjr.onrender.com
- **Purpose**: Handles Study Mode with structured educational responses
- **Model**: OpenRouter meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:free
- **Features**:
  - Structured educational responses with key concepts, examples, etc.
  - Quiz generation capabilities
  - Health endpoint: `/health`
  - Chat endpoint: `/api/chat`

#### Python Backend (Talk Mode) - READY TO DEPLOY ⏳

- **Intended URL**: https://edugen-python-backend.onrender.com
- **Purpose**: Handles Talk Mode with casual conversations + file uploads
- **Model**: Google Gemini gemini-2.0-flash-exp
- **Features**:
  - Casual conversational responses
  - File upload and analysis (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
  - Resume analysis capabilities
  - Health endpoint: `/health`
  - Chat endpoint: `/chat`

#### Frontend Updates - COMPLETED ✅

- **File**: `src/components/Chatbot.js`
- **Updates**: Routes Study Mode to Node.js backend, Talk Mode to Python backend
- **Architecture**: Dual-backend routing based on selected mode

### 🚀 Next Steps for You

#### 1. Deploy Python Backend to Render

Follow the guide in `PYTHON_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`:

1. Create new Render web service
2. Set environment variables (GOOGLE_API_KEY)
3. Deploy from `edugen-backend` folder
4. Use start command: `gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT chatbot:app`

#### 2. Update Frontend URLs (if needed)

If your Python backend gets a different URL than expected, update `Chatbot.js`:

```javascript
const talkApiUrl = "YOUR_ACTUAL_PYTHON_BACKEND_URL/chat";
```

#### 3. Test Both Modes

- **Study Mode**: Should use Node.js backend for educational responses
- **Talk Mode**: Should use Python backend for casual chat + file uploads

### 📁 File Changes Made

#### Updated Files:

- ✅ `edugen-backend/server.js` - Study Mode only, added health endpoint
- ✅ `edugen-backend/chatbot.py` - Talk Mode only, deployment ready
- ✅ `src/components/Chatbot.js` - Dual-backend routing
- ✅ `edugen-backend/requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- ✅ `edugen-backend/render-python.yaml` - Python deployment config

#### New Files:

- ✅ `PYTHON_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step deployment guide
- ✅ `DUAL_BACKEND_SETUP.md` - This summary file

### 🔗 Architecture Overview

     ↓
   Mode Check
     ↓
Study Mode → Node.js Backend (OpenRouter) → Structured Educational Responses
Talk Mode  → Python Backend (Gemini)    → Casual Chat + File Processing
```

### 🎯 Expected Behavior After Deployment

- **Study Mode**: Structured responses with sections like Overview, Key Concepts, Examples
- **Talk Mode**: Casual responses + ability to upload and analyze files
- **File Uploads**: Only work in Talk Mode, can analyze PDFs, DOCX, resumes
- **Health Checks**: Both backends have `/health` endpoints for monitoring

You're all set! Just deploy the Python backend and test both modes. 🚀
